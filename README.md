# cribby
cribby is my first non-42 project: a Vim-like editor

# What is this? Why are you coding it like this?
Well, I was learning JavaScript, and wanted to do another project.
After a little bit, I decided that a vim-like editor would be pretty neat,
especially now that I have a few termcap projects under my belt.

This project will be in accordance to my school's (Ecole 42) coding standard,
AKA "The Norme" (https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf).
This means (virtually) no standard library functions, aside from the ones
I have already recreated in my libft. This project will also use the termcap
library, which is considered low-level enough to be allowed to use, at least
in similar projects.

More info to come.
